# Word To Font

## What is it?
The right font is hard to find, especially when you know little about typefaces, fonts, typography, or design.  The purpose of this project is to crowd-source adjectives and words to be associated with fonts. In turn, users can search abstract words, moods, thoughts, or adjectives and get a list of fonts related to that word.

**In effect, it's a font search, on steroids.**

## How can I access it?
The website will be launched soon.  A link will be posted when it's live.

## What is behind it?
Backend: `Ruby-on-Rails` 

Frontend: `html`, `css`, and `javascript`

Built with some `love` and `coffee`
